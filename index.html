	<h1> MY CAREER FIELDS </h1>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li> Software engineering or development</li><br>
			<li> Data Science </li><br>
			<li> Robotics </li><br>
			<li> Programming my own thing and create a new career </li> <br>
		</ol>
		After matric i was so interested in anything that had engineering <br>
		in it and know that i have taken the computer science path <br>
		i discovered one can actually be a software engineer and <br>
		that brings all the excitement to my face.<br> 
		Software engineering is about creating programs ,codes and making<br>
		the computer do what you actually tell it to do .<br>
		Now that i am discovering new major professions like data science , they just <br>
		me activated and to do more learning as they are pretty exciting field together <br>
		with robotics . <br> <br>
		Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific<br>
		methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and <br>
		insights from structured and unstructured data.<br>
		Data science is the same concept as data mining and big data: "use the <br>
		most powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and the most<br>
		efficient algorithms to solve problems"<br>

		<h3> <a name="linkedIn"> </a> LinkedIn</h3>
		<p>
		This is the link to my linkedn account that i just created and looking forward to making it more exciting and intersting as the <br>
		time passes. <br>
		LinkedIn is a social media platform geared to professionals. It enables you to network and to build your professional portfolio,<br>
		but you can also go out into the world and look for a new job. <br>
		below is the link to LinkedIn<br>

		<h3 class="acclaim"> <a name="acclaim"></a> Acclaim </h3>
		<p>
		Acclaim is an independent initiative backed by Pearson, the world's leading learning company. <br>
		Its focal point is an enterprise-class badging platform built in compl iance with Mozilla’s open badges standards to support the <br>
		specialized needs of credential issuers, employers, and professionals. The Acclaim web platform provides a secure means <br>
		of storage, transport and credential publishing that adds a layer of protection against those who may falsely claim high-stakes credentials.<br>

		<h3> <a name="github"></a> Git-hub</h3>
			

		<p>
		Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Trovalds—the same person who created Linux. 
		Git is similar to other version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

		So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When developers create something <br> 
		(an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release.<br>

		Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. <br>
		This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision.<br>
		Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.

		Similarly, people who have nothing to do with the development of a project can still download the files and use them. <br>
		Most Linux users should be familiar with this process, as using Git, Subversion, or some other similar method is pretty common for downloading <br>
		needed files—especially in preparation for compiling a program from source code (a rather common practice for Linux geeks).<br>

		Git is the preferred version control system of most developers, since it has multiple advantages over the other systems available. <br>
		It stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better.<br>
